@phdthesis{hoag_canister_2007,

	abstract = {The objective of this thesis is to design a canister for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel
and other high-level waste in deep borehole repositories. The canister is suitable for disposal
of various waste forms, such as fuel assemblies and vitrified waste. The design addresses real
and perceived hazards of transporting and placing high-level waste, in the form of spent reactor
fuel, into a deep igneous rock environment. The thermal performance of the design is
emphasized.
To provide an option for second generation repositories at a competitive cost, the
canister reference design is based on standard oil drilling technology. Calculations are
conducted to assess stresses in the waste string and granite, temperatures and thermal gradients,
sensitivity of thermal calculations to variables, and cost. Recommendations are made for
future work.},

nuclear fuel (SNF) and/or high-level radioactive waste (HLW). Technical considerations include
geological, hydrogeochemical, and geophysical characteristics that are related to the suitability of the site
for deep drilling and borehole construction, waste emplacement activities, waste isolation (seals and
surrounding geology), and long-term safety of the deep borehole disposal system. Logistical factors to be
considered include: local or regional availability of drilling contractors (equipment, services, and
materials) capable of drilling a large-diameter hole to approximately 5,000 m depth; construction of
surface facilities and waste handling and emplacement equipment; legal and regulatory requirements
associated with drilling, operation, and post-closure; and access to transportation systems. Social and
political considerations include the distance from population centers and the support or opposition of local
and state entities and other stakeholders to the facility and its operations. These technical, logistical, and
sociopolitical factors are examined in the context of a consent-based siting process for a deep disposal
borehole, which would be the first phase in developing an operating facility.},
