	abstract = {This paper describes considerations for siting and designing a facility for deep borehole disposal of spent
nuclear fuel (SNF) and/or high-level radioactive waste (HLW). Technical considerations include
geological, hydrogeochemical, and geophysical characteristics that are related to the suitability of the site
for deep drilling and borehole construction, waste emplacement activities, waste isolation (seals and
surrounding geology), and long-term safety of the deep borehole disposal system. Logistical factors to be
considered include: local or regional availability of drilling contractors (equipment, services, and
materials) capable of drilling a large-diameter hole to approximately 5,000 m depth; construction of
surface facilities and waste handling and emplacement equipment; legal and regulatory requirements
associated with drilling, operation, and post-closure; and access to transportation systems. Social and
political considerations include the distance from population centers and the support or opposition of local
and state entities and other stakeholders to the facility and its operations. These technical, logistical, and
sociopolitical factors are examined in the context of a consent-based siting process for a deep disposal
borehole, which would be the first phase in developing an operating facility.},

and other high-level waste in deep borehole repositories. The canister is suitable for disposal
of various waste forms, such as fuel assemblies and vitrified waste. The design addresses real
and perceived hazards of transporting and placing high-level waste, in the form of spent reactor
fuel, into a deep igneous rock environment. The thermal performance of the design is
emphasized.
To provide an option for second generation repositories at a competitive cost, the
canister reference design is based on standard oil drilling technology. Calculations are
conducted to assess stresses in the waste string and granite, temperatures and thermal gradients,
sensitivity of thermal calculations to variables, and cost. Recommendations are made for
future work.},

north  and  the  Kankakee  River  to  the  east.    A  cooling  lake,  which  was  formed  by  
constructing an impervious earth-fill dike, encompasses a storage area of approximately 
1275 acres.  The lake is connected to the intake and discharge flumes of Units 2 and 3 
by  two  canals  (one  intake  and  one  discharge);  each  canal  is  about  11,000  feet  long.    
Dresden Units 2 and 3 are BWR/3’s designed and supplied by GE Nuclear Energy with 
251  inch  vessels.    The  primary  containment  of  each  unit  is  of  the  Mark  1  design  that  
consists of a drywell, a suppression chamber in the shape of a torus and a connecting 
vent system between the drywell and the suppression chamber.  Each unit is authorized 
to operate at a steady state reactor power level not to exceed 2957 megawatts thermal.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy recently filed a motion to withdraw the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission license application for the High Level Waste Repository at
Yucca Mountain in Nevada. As the U.S. has focused exclusively on geologic disposal in
shallow mined repositories for the past two decades, an examination of disposal
alternatives will be necessary should the Yucca Mountain Project be terminated. This
provides an opportunity to study other promising waste disposal technologies. One such
technology is the use of very deep boreholes in monolithic granite to permanently
segregate high level wastes from the biosphere. While research in this field has focused
on vertical emplacement techniques, horizontal emplacement offers the significant
advantages of allowing increased emplacement lengths without crushing of the waste
package and the use of a single vertical shaft for drilling multiple horizontal shafts. This
project examines the application of currently deployed oil and natural gas directional
drilling techniques to borehole design. A large trade-space of potential borehole
configurations is evaluated and a final design selected using the "V-DeepBoRe" code, a
Monte-Carlo simulation based cost model for borehole construction and waste package
emplacement. Waste repackaging and reconstitution is evaluated to permit deployment
of waste in borehole diameters too small for intact fuel assemblies. A 5 m x 195.26 mm
(OD) cylindrical waste package is designed using P-110 drill string steel to meet strength
and thermal loading requirements; fuel centerline temperatures are shown to not exceed
190'C by analytical and finite element methods. The total cost of a national borehole
repository (including drilling, consolidating and encapsulating the fuel, emplacement, and
closure) is shown to fall below \$63/kgHM, well within the capacity of the DOE
Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Waste Fund.},
