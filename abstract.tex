This work evaluates a potential solution for two pressing matters in the viability of
nuclear energy: spent fuel disposal and power plants that no longer operate. The 
potential benefits of siting a borehole repository at a shut-down nuclear power 
plant facility are analyzed from the perspective of myriad stakeholders. 
Preliminary results indicate that integrated siting will make economic 
use of the shut-down power plant, take advantage of spent fuel handling 
infrastructure at those sites, help to empty the crowded spent 
fuel storage pools at nearby reactors, and will do so at sites more likely to 
have consenting communities.
